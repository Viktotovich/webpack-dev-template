# webpack-template
Webpack development template for use in other projects to have a head-start. Most of the code for setting up the webpack environment is same - this is taking advantage of that fact.

NPM scripts, prod, development, and other configs including ESLint is set-up. (Except Prettier, as it's much easier to make do with the VSCode extention instead)
